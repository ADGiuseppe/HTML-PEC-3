            <h2>Steps to Become an Instructor</h2>
            <p>
                Instructors create lesson plans and implement them in a classroom or on online platforms. 
                While formal education is necessary, instructors must also possess skills that you can't alwavs learn in an academic setting. 
                Successful instructors excel at communication, leadership, and problem-solving. Remember that, as an instructor, you're responsible
                for educating a diverse group of people, so it's essential to have empathy and cultural awareness. Having a mentor in the field can
                give you insight into balancing the curriculum with your student's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take these steps if you want to become an instructor.

            <div class="step-details">
                <h3>1. Earn a relevant degree to what you want to instruct</h3>
                <p>Colleges and universities expect instructors to have at least a bachelor's degree in the subject they want to teach. For example, if you want to teach literature, you should have a Bachelor of Arts in English. Many schools prefer candidates with master's degrees, and even if they don't, it's well worth it to pursue one. A master's degree can help you stand out among potential hires and make you eligible for salary increases and promotions. If you plan on earning tenure or want to participate in academic research, you'll need to earn your doctorate after completing your bachelor's and master's degrees.</p>

                <h3>2. Apply for teaching assistant positions</h3>
                <p>While completing your degree, you should apply for <abbr title="Teaching Assistant">TA</abbr> positions at your college, which can give you practical experience and look good on your resume. Undergrad <abbr title="Teaching Assistant">TA</abbr>s typically assist professors with grading papers and proctoring exams. If you work as a <abbr title="Teaching Assistant">TA</abbr> in grad school, you can expect to teach classes, work with students in lab settings, and assist the professor with research.</p>

                <h3>3. Apply for instructor positions</h3>
                <p>After you've earned your degree and gained experience as a <abbr title="Teaching Assistant">TA</abbr>, it's time to apply for instructor jobs. It isn't uncommon for instructors to start in <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/adjunct-professor-jobs-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">entry-level positions like adjunct instructor</a> or assistant instructor, so don't get discouraged if you don't land your dream job right away.

                    You might even consider becoming a private tutor, educational consultant, or curriculum writer, especially if you've been working as an
                    instructor and need a change of scenery.
