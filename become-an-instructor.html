            <h2>Steps to Become an Instructor</h2>
            <p>
                Instructors create lesson plans and implement them in a classroom or on online platforms. 
                While formal education is necessary, instructors must also possess skills that you can't alwavs learn in an academic setting. 
                Successful instructors excel at communication, leadership, and problem-solving. Remember that, as an instructor, you're responsible
                for educating a diverse group of people, so it's essential to have empathy and cultural awareness. Having a mentor in the field can
                give you insight into balancing the curriculum with your student's needs.

                Take these steps if you want to become an instructor.

                <h3>1. Earn a relevant degree to what you want to instruct</h3>
                <p>Colleges and universities expect instructors to have at least a bachelor's degree in the subject they want to teach. For example, if you want to teach literature, you should have a Bachelor of Arts in English. Many schools prefer candidates with master's degrees, and even if they don't, it's well worth it to pursue one. A master's degree can help you stand out among potential hires and make you eligible for salary increases and promotions. If you plan on earning tenure or want to participate in academic research, you'll need to earn your doctorate after completing your bachelor's and master's degrees.</p>
